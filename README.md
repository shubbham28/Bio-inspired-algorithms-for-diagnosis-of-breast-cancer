It is a research paper published in IJICA, 2019

In this project I had extracted and compared the efficiency of four bio-inspired algorithms which are Ant Colony Optimization, Artificial Bee Colony Optimization, Particle Swarm Optimization, Firefly Algorithm.     

I had compared the result of each of the mentioned algorithm in four different classifiers which are Linear Support Vector Machine, Decision Tree, K-Nearest Neighbors, and Random Forest and worked on Breast Cancer Dataset from the UCI Repository.    

I built the project code on python and used machine learning for research
